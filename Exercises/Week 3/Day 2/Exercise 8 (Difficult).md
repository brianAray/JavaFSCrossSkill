# Exercise 8 (Difficult)
## Task
Extend the previous exercise by introducing a service to manage the state instead of passing it through `@Input`. Inject the service in both parent and child components, and use it to get and update the state. Implement event emitters in the service to notify the components of state changes and subscribe to those events in the components.
