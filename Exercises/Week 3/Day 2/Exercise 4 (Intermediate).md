# Exercise 4 (Intermediate)
## Task
Extend the previous exercise by adding a button in the child component for each item. When a button is clicked, emit an event with the selected item's ID from the child component using `@Output`. Capture this event in the parent component and remove the corresponding item from the array. Update the child component to display the updated list.
