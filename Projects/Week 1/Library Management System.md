    - Implement the necessary methods for setting and retrieving the book details.
2. Design the LibraryMember class:
    - Define the attributes of a library member, such as name, ID, contact details, etc.
    - Implement the necessary methods for setting and retrieving the member details.
3. Design the Library class:
    - Create an ArrayList to store the collection of books.
    - Implement methods to add a book, remove a book, and display all books in the library.
    - Create an ArrayList to store the collection of library members.
    - Implement methods to register a member, display all members, and handle book borrowing and returning.
4. Implement the main method:
    - Create an instance of the Library class.
    - Prompt the user with a menu to select the desired operation (add book, remove book, etc.).
    - Based on the user's input, call the respective methods in the Library class to perform the operations.
5. Test the functionality:
    - Execute the program and test the different features of the library management system.
    - Add books, register members, borrow and return books, and verify the results.

Remember to handle any input validation and error conditions, such as checking if a book is available for borrowing, handling invalid inputs, etc.
