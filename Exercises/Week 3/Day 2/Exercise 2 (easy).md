# Exercise 2 (Easy)
## Task
Extend the previous exercise by adding a button in the `ChildComponent`. When the button is clicked, emit an event from the `ChildComponent` using `@Output` and capture it in the `ParentComponent`. In the `ParentComponent`, update the string value and pass it back to the `ChildComponent` to display the updated value.
